## How is the communication between the host and the graphic card handled?

## What function executes your kernel?

## How does the kernel know what element to work on?

## What timing did you get for your GPU reduction? Compare it to the CPU version.

## Try larger data size. On what size does the GPU version get faster, or at least comparable, to the CPU?

## How can you optimize this further? You should know at least one way.

## Should each thread produce one output or two? Why?

## How many items can you handle in one workgroup?

## What problem must be solved when you use more than one workgroup? How did you solve it?

## What time do you get? Difference to the CPU? What is the break even size? What can you expect for a parallel CPU version? (Your conclusions here may vary between the labs.)
